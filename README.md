# Robust smoothing algorithm with missing values

This code is a Python implementation of the ``smoothn(y)`` algorithm described by Garc√≠a (2010). The original source code (Matlab) can be found [here](https://www.biomecardio.com/en/download.html).

The smoothn function achieves a fast and robust smoothing of multidimensional gridded data by using the discrete cosine transform to fit the points. It can handle missing data, providing either a solution for predict data with a low smoothing factor. The robust approach works well for outlier points, wich are not detected as missing values, so the approximation does not tries to overfits to those points.
